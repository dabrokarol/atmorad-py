## Overview:

This project simulates the propagation of light through a heterogenous, plane-parallel atmosphere and their interactions with mixed surface boundaries. It is my student project that I created to learn computational physics and software development.

### Physical model
- **Discrete photons**: Photons are treated as discrete particles, not as variable packets of energy. Energy is counted as a fraction of total photons. 
- **Plane-parallel approximation**: Atmosphere consists of horizontally uniform layers.
- **Multi-material atmospheric layers**: layers can consist of a few atmospheric materials simultaneously. A photon is assigned a material randomly when it is initialized and again when it crosses into a new layer. Each material has its own optical density, single-scattering albedo and phase function.
- **Custom Phase-Functions**: Henyey-Greenstein and Rayleigh phase function are already implemented in the simulation, but any custom user-defined function can be constructed using the `Scattering` class.
- **Surface Reflections**: Surface consists of materials, each of which having its albedo, a predefined reflection (`Lambertian`, `Mirror`) and a `ProceduralMap` that outputs material ID based on coordinates.
- **Photon Properties**: Light is treated as monochromatic, non-polarized particles. During the simulation they can get scattered, reflected or absorbed. 
- **Incident Flux & Adjacency Effect**: Custom detectors allow measuring downward/upward flux at any arbitrary altitude - helpful for visualizing adjacency effect.


## Technical implementation:
- Simulation uses `numpy` to simulate photons simultaneously in large batches.
- Results are plotted using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (eg. photon paths, flux profile, 2d ground flux map)
- Code uses multiprocessing to run batches in parallel.
  
## How to run:
### Use UV (Recommended & Fastest)
- If not installed, [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), a very fast Python package manager.
- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```
- Modify parameters `default_config.toml` or create a custom config.
- Run the simulation:
```bash
uv run atmorad <path-to-config.toml>
```
- Check `results/` directory for simulation outputs and plots

### Core Architecture:
- `engine/`: divides photons into batches and runs the simulation.
- `Scene`: keeps track of the environment.
- `Atmosphere` and `Surface`: keep track of optical properties, phase functions, reflection functions and layer structures.
- `ResultAnalyzer`: Generates plots based on simulation results.
